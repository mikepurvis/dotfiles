vim
===

It's super easy to get going. Set me up like so:

    wget https://raw.github.com/mikepurvis/vim/master/setup.bash -O - | bash

Note that if you have an existing ~/.vim folder, the installation will fail, and if
you have an existing ~/.vimrc file, it will be moved to ~/.vimrc.bak. The shebang
installation is most suited to setting up a new installation, or freshening a previous
installation of this config.
